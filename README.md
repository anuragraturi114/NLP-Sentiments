Poseidon is a yoga pose detection project that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect and track yoga poses in real time. It is deployed on Streamlit and provides users with a variety of features, including the ability to set model parameters, display real-time input and output streams with landmark recording, and use both cameras and uploaded files as input.
